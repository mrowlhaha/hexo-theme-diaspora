**S**uddenly woke up in the middle of night with my whole sheet wet.Light my phone,it was just 3 a.m.That was a really horrorable nightmare.After a few moment,I calmed down from the deep sorrow by took a deep breath.But the real crul reality started appearing in my mind------the long deep silence night.

The brain was gradually clear along with my vision perceiced nothing and my ears heard no voice.Got out of  my bed and walked in the bathroom,there was a moment that I stood and I could't distinguish which I was in a dreamland or the real life.But my mind is truly consecious,which not means I have mental illness or something else.And then I realized that couldn't discern those cuz they are too similar.**It  is not the reality of the dream but the teduim of my life**.
